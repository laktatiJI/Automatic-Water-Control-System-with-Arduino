Abstract

This project focuses on designing an automatic water control system that turns water on when a hand approaches the faucet and turns it off when the hand moves away. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the proximity of the hand. The main goal of this project is to teach the basics of electronics and robotics through practical learning. By using an Arduino, a 5V pump, a 5V relay, a battery, and connecting wires, this system provides an easy-to-understand way to introduce automation in everyday tasks such as hand washing.

Introduction

Automation is becoming an essential part of everyday life, from simple household tasks to complex industrial processes. One common application is the automatic control of water flow, which can improve efficiency and hygiene. This project aims to design a basic Automatic Water Control System using Arduino. The system detects when a hand approaches a faucet and automatically controls the water flow, providing a convenient and efficient way to use water without manual intervention.
This project is intended as a learning tool to introduce both children and adults to the fundamentals of robotics and electronics. By building this system, learners will gain hands-on experience with sensors, relays, and microcontrollers, making it an ideal project for developing skills that can be applied in more advanced studies, especially in engineering and technology fields.
